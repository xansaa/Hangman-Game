The rules of the game Hangman are well-known and quite simple. You need to guess the hidden word or phrase, which is represented by dashes (each dash corresponds to one letter).

Choose a letter from the alphabet. If the letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed in its respective position within the dashes.

You have the right to make nine mistakes, on the tenth one, you will be "hanged."
